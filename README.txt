Installation
------------------
To install you need to first install NodeJS. There are several ways to
do this, but perhaps the easiest way to do this from a Windows machine
is to visit the NodeJS site directly and download the program.

` https://nodejs.org/en/`

After that is downloaded, go to the root of this directory, and execute
the following command.

`npm install`

This will install all dependancies that are stated under *package.json*.

Next you should be able to run the following command inorder to get the
webserver to serve you the *index.html*.

`npm start`

Console output tells you to go visit the stated url. An example is:

http://localhost:8080

You should be able to edit
`app/index.html`,
`app/js/script.js`, and
`app/css/main.css`
to do your app.
